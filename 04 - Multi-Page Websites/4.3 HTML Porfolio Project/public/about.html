<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Natnael, a student of Software Engineering at Addis Ababa University. 
  I am curious about how technology does what it does and how it can be used to solve real-life issues. 
  I have learned the fundamentals of programming, data structures, and algorithms from my studies. 
  I push myself beyond the classroom to break and create things in order to learn better.
</p>
<p>I am particularly interested in a mix of low-level systems programming and high-level software design. 
  I prefer optimizing backend performance, trying to understand version control systems like Git, and 
  crafting clean and responsive user interfaces. I dive headfirst into everything software development.
</p>
<p>I've already taken fundamental courses such as Database Systems, Data Structures and Algorithms 
  in C++, Object-Oriented Programming, Python Programming, and Fundamentals of Networking. I've also 
  taken mathematically based courses such as Discrete Mathematics and Applied Mathematics I, II, and 
  III. They've given me a solid background both in programming and in more domain-based Software 
  Engineering concepts that I'd like to keep studying.
</p>
<p>I like clean, readable, and sensible code along with learning for life. I'm currently learning 
  version control internals and web development. I eventually would like to understand how large 
  systems like distributed systems and development tools are built from the ground up.
</p>
<p>Aside from technical work, I believe in discipline and consistency. I'm not opposed to fighting 
  with tricky code, reworking the same thing multiple times, or even abandoning a project when it 
  can teach me something valuable. My goal is to be a developer who not only knows how to code but 
  also painstakingly is concerned about how it's done and how it impacts things. My hobbies include 
  playing table tennis, football, and video games to keep active, competitive, and creative.
</p>
<p>I'm just starting out, but to me, every obstacle, every bug, and every build is a step towards 
  mastery.
