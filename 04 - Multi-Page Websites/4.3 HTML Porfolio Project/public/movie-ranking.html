<h1>The Best Movies Accoring to Nati</h1>
<h2>My top 7 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>I Am Number Four</h3>
<p>
  This is because it's one of my childhood memories. And the first movie i
  watched while staying up late at night for the first time.
</p>
<h3>The Harry Potter Series</h3>
<p>
  This is also one of the best movies that i have ever watched as a child and
  rewatched it again after being an adult. It has so much childhood memories and
  great story.
</p>
<h3>50 First Dates</h3>
<p>This is one of my all-time favourite romantic-comedy movies.</p>
<h3>I Am Legend</h3>
<p>
  This is the first horror movie that i have ever watched. And it was soo cool
  cause it was a first time experience.
</p>
<h3>The Originals</h3>
<p>
  This is definitely one of the top 3 best romantic movies i have ever watched,
  and it's also a historical fanatcy which makes it wayyy more interesting.
</p>
<h3>Attack On Titan</h3>
<p>
  This is the best anime i have ever watched, maybe even better than most
  hollywood movies i watched through out the years.
</p>
<h3>Money Heist</h3>
<p>
  This is crime drama, but it has a really good and realistic story in addition
  to it's exciting and interesting episodes that makes you wonder how can
  someone create a story like this out of based on only their imagination.
